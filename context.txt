Build me a website called Blood Donation Management System. Where there will be two types of users called Donor and Hospital. If a donor signed in they will see the hospital lists with their info and if a hospital signed in they will see the donor lists with their info. There will be two tables for them called donor_info and hospital_info in Supabase. They will have different information in the sign up form. When a donor will sign up the form data will go to the donor_info table and if a hospital sign up the form data will go to the hospital_info table. When a donor will sign in it will verify the email and password from the donor_info table and when a hospital will sign in it will verify with the hospital_info table. In the donor_info table the column will be email, password, name, bloodGroup, age, phoneNumber and the hospital_info will have email, password, name, address, bloodGroup, quantity, urgency.
